Unsupervised Machine Learning: Module 18

An investment firm is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies, so they asked me to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. To complete this project I had used unsupervised machine learning to process and to cluster the data, and to reduce your dimensions, and finally to reduce the principal components using PCA.
